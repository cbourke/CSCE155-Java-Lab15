# Lab 15.0 - Worksheet

Name(s) and Login(s):



1. Look over the code provided in the `DatabaseInfo.java` and 
   `GamesDatabaseUtils.java` and answer the following.
 a. Which method should be used to add a platform to the database 
    and what are its parameters?    
    
    
    
 b. What type of SQL query is used to add records to the database 
    (hint: look at the `addPlatform`, `addVideoGame`, `addPublisher` 
    methods)?    
    
    
    
 c. What type of SQL query is used to retrieve records from the 
    database (hint: look at the `getGame`, `getPlatform`, etc. 
    methods).
    
    
2. Activity 3: Data Integrity
 a. What error messages did you get and why?        


 b. A bad database design may not have properly defined the foreign 
    keys between the game and publisher tables, instead allowing 
    the bad game data that we attempted to insert into the database.  
    What consequences could this have for a larger application?          
    
    
    
 c. Consider the following: two programs or users use our API to 
    add two different games to the database, both PlayStation 3 
    games.  However, the first user inserts the platform as "PS3" 
    and the second inserts it as "PlayStation III".  Would this 
    result in an error?  What would the consequences of this be 
    for a larger application?          



 d. Suppose we wanted to remove a publisher from the database.  
    What would we need to do before we could remove the record?
